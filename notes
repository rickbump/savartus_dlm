Media Storage & Project Management: We utilize Lucidlink as our virtual NAS to store and share large media files. We need a MAM lite solution that can integrate easily with this and other apps in our stack, including Asana (project management), Adobe Creative Suite, and Frame.io.
-This is probably the ask that will require the least development work.  However, we’d need to know what interface LucidLink uses for their Virtual NAS to be more certain.



Content Delivery: We need the ability to seamlessly create branded presentations that go beyond just adding a UTA logo. This should include multiple types of media—videos, PDFs, images—and customizable text fields such as bios and social media links.
-This is not functionality that we have, nor is it on the roadmap to the best of my knowledge.  The closest SOPHIA has is Collections, which allows multiple assets to be grouped.  However, it does combine assets into a single presentation or video.



Playlist Functionality: The option to version-stack, rearrange assets, and manage playlists in a user-friendly manner, allowing for continuous updates as needed.
-Again, this is closest to Collections, but we don’t have the ability to control or adjust asset order within the collection.



Customizable Templates: Our brand design team has the ability to create custom templates, and we’d like these to be flexible enough for quick adjustments and customization for different use cases.
-No functionality exists to achieve this in SOPHIA



Data & Analytics: Insightful data on user engagement is crucial. Metrics like how long content is viewed, which assets are performing well, and real-time updates to agents when content is frequently engaged would be ideal.
-SOPHIA does allow for analytics and reporting on engagement with shared assets.  Real-time updates is not a standard feature.



We’ve explored Shift.io (now EditShare), which meets many of these needs but lacks mobile optimization for presentation pages, which is essential since 50% of our audience engages via mobile.



Variety of Workstreams: We have a wide range of teams across UTA, and each operates with distinct workflows.



For instance:



News & Broadcasting: Clients often provide media, and our team logs and edits the material. Assets need to be compiled into playlists and shared with buyers, making ease of playlist creation and media management crucial.


Talent Teams: We source media ourselves and send it to agents for feedback. The media is then clipped and tailored to specific client needs before being delivered. This team is not tech-heavy, so ease of use for agents and assistants is vital.


Speakers Team: They manage a lot of client content, including sizzles and excerpts from speeches. These assets need to be housed internally while also being easily pushed to external sites for visibility.


Across all these workflows, non-creative and non-technical teams like assistants and agents will need easy access to the platform to retrieve, compile, and distribute media assets. The platform must be intuitive enough for those without deep technical skills to navigate efficiently. This is especially important for agents or assistants who need to quickly assemble branded presentations with multiple media types and customizable elements without needing constant support from creative or production teams.
